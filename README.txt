DEFENDER
By: Joe Polin, Hamza Qaiser, Jeremy Benson

DEFENDER is loosely based on games like Galaga and Space Invaders, but instead of opposing enemies there are asteroids that you must shoot and destroy. The idea is a) not let any of the asteroids strike your home planet (get below you on the screen) and b) not let any of the asteroids hit your ship. Upon either of these cases, the game is over.

We implemented the following features:
- x-constrained movement, no motion in y-direction
- ability to shoot at angles between +60 and -60 degrees
- play/pause button
- reset button
- randomly located asteroids that spawn with
- three random sizes
- a behind-the-scenes pseudo level system that makes more asteroids spawn as time goes on
- a clock that counts seconds you've been alive
- scoreboard which keeps track of number of asteroids destroyed
- using .jpg/png files for title, ship, and background images
- keys which serve purpose as some of the buttons (variety/options for the player)

Contributions:
Joe: main GUI, shooting mechanics, all things related to sine and/or cosine
Hamza: collisions, randomly spawning asteroids, pseudo-level system
Jeremy: clock, scoreboard/scoring, reset button, play/pause button, randomly size asteroids, using .jpg/png files

Notes:
Although our game is not exactly what we had outlined/had in mind in the beginning, this final product is something we all felt was very satisfactory given its seeming simplicity in both gameplay and aesthetic, it's "fun factor" while playing, and amount of time we had as a group and individually to work on this assignment. Given more time, we would have liked to implement a more GUI-centric help menu and splash screen, and potentially some sort of life system (with icons) and power ups from destroying asteroids. Some challenges we faced were getting the rotations to behave as needed, and getting the clock to play nicely with the play/pause and reset buttons.

A big thank you to both the TAs and Richard for a fun and enjoyable semester, and we hope you enjoy our game!


Thank you,
